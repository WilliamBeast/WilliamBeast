        Transistor: The transistor was invented by three scientists at the Bell Laboratories in 1947, and it rapidly replaced <br>
         the vacuum tube as an electronic signal regulator. A transistor is a device that regulates current or voltage flow and <br>
         acts as a switch or gate for electronic signals. Transistors consist of three layers of a semiconductor material, each <br>
          capable of carrying
            a current.

        <p>
            Cpu: A processor is the logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions that drive a computer.<br>
             The four primary functions of a processor are fetch, decode, execute and writeback
        </p>
        <p>
                Most processors today are multi-core, which means that the IC contains two or more processors for enhanced <br>
                performance, reduced power consumption and more efficient simultaneous processing of multiple tasks . Multi-core<br>
                 set-ups are similar to having multiple, separate processors installed in the same computer, but because the <br>
                 processors are actually plugged into the same socket, the connection between them is faster. 
        </p>
        <p>
                The term processor is used interchangeably with the term central processing unit (CPU), although strictly speaking,<br>
                 the CPU is not the only processor in a computer. The GPU (graphics processing unit) is the most notable example but<br>
                  the hard drive and other devices within a computer also perform some processing independently. Nevertheless, the term <br>
                  processor is generally understood to mean the CPU.
