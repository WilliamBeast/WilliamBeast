            A byte is a sequence of 8 bits (enough to represent one alphanumeric character) processed as a single unit of<br> 
            information. A single letter or character would use one byte of memory (8 bits), two characters would use two <br>
            bytes (16 bits).
        </p>
        <p>
            Put another way, a bit is either an 'on' or an 'off' which is processed by a computer processor, we represent <br>
            'on' as '1' and 'off' as '0'. 8 bits are known as a byte, and it is bytes which are used to pass our information <br>
            in it's basic form - characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alphanumeric character (e.g. a letter or number such as 'A', 'B' or '7') is stored as 1 byte. For example, <br>
            to store the letter 'R' uses 1 byte, which is stored by the computer as 8 bits, '01010010'.

        Hardisk: A hard disk is part of a unit, often called a "disk drive," "hard drive," or "hard disk drive," that stores <br>
         and provides relatively quick access to large amounts of data on an electromagnetically charged surface or set of <br>
         surfaces. Today's computers typically come with a hard disk that contains several billion bytes (gigabytes) of storage.

    <p>
        SSD: A solid-state drive (SSD) is a nonvolatile storage device that stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory.<br>
          Solid-state drives actually aren't hard drives in the traditional sense of the term, as there are no moving parts involved.
