            jpg: JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is an ISO/IEC group of experts that develops and maintains standards <br>
            for a suite of compression algorithms

            PNG:  (pronounced ping as in ping-pong; for Portable Network Graphics) is a file format for image compression that, <br>
            in time, is expected to replace the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) that is widely used on today's Internet
        </p>
        <p>
            GIF: GIF er et 8-bit-per-piksel bitmap-billedformat som brukes for å lagre bilder. Formatet bruker en palett med <br>
            opptil 256 forskjellige farger fra 24-bit RGB-fargerommet.
        </p>
        <p>
            BMP: Short for "Bitmap." It can be pronounced as "bump," "B-M-P," or simply a "bitmap image." The BMP format is a <br>
            commonly used raster graphic format for saving image files. It was introduced on the Windows platform, but is now <br>
            recognized by many programs on both Macs and PCs.
        </p>
        <p>
            
            The BMP format stores color data for each pixel in the image without any compression. For example, a 10x10 pixel <br>
            BMP image will include color data for 100 pixels. This method of storing image information allows for crisp, <br>
            high-quality graphics, but also produces large file sizes. The JPEG and GIF formats are also bitmaps, but use <br>
            image compression algorithms that can significantly decrease their file size. For this reason, JPEG and GIF images<br>
             are used on the Web, while BMP images are often used for printable images.
        </p>

            SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is the description of an image as an application of the Extensible Markup Language<br>
             (XML). Any program such as a Web browser that recognizes XML can display the image using the information provided in <br>
             the SVG format. Different from a raster graphicsscalable part of the term emphasizes that vector graphic images can <br>
             easily be made scalable (whereas an image specified in raster graphics is a fixed-size bitmap). Thus, the SVG format <br>
             enables the viewing of an image on a computer display of any size and resolution, whether a tiny LCD screen in a cell <br>
             phone or a large CRT display in a workstation. In addition to ease of size reduction and enlargement, SVG allows text <br>
             within images to be recognized as such, so that the text can be located by a search engine and easily translated into <br>
             other languages.
